# Tutorial 07

This tutorial (held in Week 08) will look at Interaction Design and Shneiderman's Principles.

Typically, the tutorials will be broken into distinct tasks where you are encouraged to either work in small groups or discuss the material openly with the wider tutorial class. Where applicable, the tutorial tasks will relate directly to your assignment development. Engagement with this process will assist your understanding of the assignment requirements and may contribute toward the deliverables.

For each task listed below, edit the markdown file with your own observations and answers.  After the discussion has occurred in class, annotate or amend your discussion points based on the conversations had with the wider tutorial group.

## Task 01

Shneiderman's Principles dictate a range of things, one of them is recognising diversity.  Provide an example of an existing software application that follows this principle.  Describe the software and the feature that implements this diversity.

## Task 02

What are the four ways to implement error prevention?  Describe mechanisms used in modern software systems intended to prevent user errors.

## Task 03

Describe a mechanism that we can use to promote the usersâ€™ sense of agency over the systems that they are working with.

## Task 04

## Project Work
